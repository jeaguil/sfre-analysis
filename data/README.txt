Data includes weather forecast for 12 weather variables.
Obtained from ECMWF

Hourly measurements for each solar power plant from
2012 04 01 01:00 to 2014 07 01 00:00

ZoneId are power plants identified from 1 to 3.
Power attributes records the hourly solar power generation.

VAR 78: Total column liquid water (tclw) measured in kg m^-2
    Vertical Integral of cloud liquid water content.

Var 79: Total coluimn ice water (tciw) measured in kg m^-2
    Vertical Integral of cloud ice water content.

Var 134: Surface pressure (SP) measure in Pa

Var 157: Relative humidity at 1000 mbar (r) measured in %
    Relative humidity is defined with respect to saturation of
    the mixed phase, i.e., with respect to saturation over ice
    below -23 C and with respect to saturation over water
    above 0 C. In the regime in between, a quadratic interpolation
    is applied.

Var 164: Total cloud cover (TCC) measured 0-1
    Total cloud cover derived from model levels using the
    model's overlap assumption.

Var 165: 10-metre U wind component (10u) measured in m s^-1

Var 166: 10-metre V wind component (10v) measured in m s^-1

Var 167: 2-metre temperature (2T) measured in K

Var 169: Surface solar rad down (SSRD) measured in J m^-2
    Accumulated field.

Var 175: Surface thermal rad down (STRD) measured in J m^-2
    Accumulated field.

Var 178: Top net solar rad (TSR) measured in J m^-2
    Net solar radiation at the top of the atmospher.
    Accumulated field.

Var 228: Total precipitation (TP) measured in m
    Convective precipitation + stratiform precipitation
    (CP + LSP). Accumulated field.
